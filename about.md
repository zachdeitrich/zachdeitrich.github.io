<section class="about">
<p>Hi there! I'm Zach Deitrich. From humble beginnings in <span>C</span> and <span>C++</span> in the 90's to writing <span><i class="fas fa-database"></i> SQL queries</span> and <span><i class="fas fa-barcode"></i> ZPL labels</span> nowadays that make sense of an enterprise fleet of client devices, I bring decades of experience to designing and developing solutions.</p>
<p>Over the years my creative approach to code has taken me from developing <span><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i> Facebook apps</span> (on the precursor to their revolutionary <span><i class="fab fa-react"></i> React</span> platform) to custom <span><i class="fab fa-wordpress"></i> WordPress</span> theme and plugin development. I also love to share knowledge, which is why I've tutored undergrad <span><i class="fab fa-java"></i> Java</span> students and consulted for small businesses on <span><i class="fas fa-users"></i> social media</span> strategy.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding I'm usually doing something else creative, like <span><i class="fas fa-guitar"></i> making music</span>, <span><i class="fas fa-beer"></i> brewing beer</span>, or <span><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> prototyping electronics</span>.</p>
